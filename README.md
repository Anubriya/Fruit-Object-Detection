# Fruit-Object-Detection
🍎🍌🍊 Fruit Detection using YOLOv8  A deep-learning project that detects Apples, Bananas, and Oranges using a trained YOLOv8 Object Detection model. This project includes dataset preparation, training, evaluation, visualization, Streamlit app deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Trained YOLOv8n model on custom fruit dataset  
- Evaluated using:
  - Precision, Recall
  - mAP50, mAP50-95
  - Confusion Matrix
  - PR Curves  
- Built a Streamlit Web App for real-time fruit detection  
- Hosted online using Hugging Face Spaces
